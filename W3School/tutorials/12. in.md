The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
```
Or
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);
```

The following SQL statement selects all customers that are located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
```
The following SQL statement selects all customers that are NOT located in "Germany", "France" or "UK":
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
```
The following SQL statement selects all customers that are from the same countries as the suppliers:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);
```
