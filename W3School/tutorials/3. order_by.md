## The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

## The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

```sql

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```

## ORDER BY Several Columns 

- Example 1
The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column. This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;
```
- Example 2
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
```
