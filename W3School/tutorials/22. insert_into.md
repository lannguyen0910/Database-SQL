The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.

The INSERT INTO SELECT statement requires that the data types in source and target tables match.

Note: The existing records in the target table are unaffected.

Copy all columns from one table to another table:

```sql
INSERT INTO table2
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE condition;
Copy only some columns from one table into another table:
```

```sql
INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition;
```

The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (the columns that are not filled with data, will contain NULL):

Example
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers;

```
The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (fill all columns):

Example
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country FROM Suppliers;
```
The following SQL statement copies only the German suppliers into "Customers":

Example
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany';
```
