The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

- Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
- The columns must also have similar data types
- The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

The following SQL statement returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
```sql
SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
```
Note: If some customers or suppliers have the same city, each city will only be listed once, because UNION selects only distinct values. Use UNION ALL to also select duplicate values!

The following SQL statement returns the German cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
```sql
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
```
