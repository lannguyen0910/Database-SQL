A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

Stored Procedure Syntax
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
sql_statement
GO;
```
Execute a Stored Procedure
```sql
EXEC procedure_name;
```

Stored Procedure With One Parameter
The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City from the "Customers" table:

Example
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
GO;
```
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:

Example
```sql
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London';
```

Stored Procedure With Multiple Parameters
Setting up multiple parameters is very easy. Just list each parameter and the data type separated by a comma as shown below.

The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City with a particular PostalCode from the "Customers" table:

Example
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
GO;
```
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:

Example
```sql
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';
```
