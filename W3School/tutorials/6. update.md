## The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
- Example
```sql
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

```
Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!
