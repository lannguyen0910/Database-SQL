SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

An alias only exists for the duration of that query.

An alias is created with the AS keyword.

```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name;
```

The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:
```sql
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;
```

The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. Note: It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces:
```sql
SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
FROM Customers;
```

The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):
```sql
SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers;
```
To get the SQL statement above to work in MySQL use the following:
```sql
SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address
FROM Customers;
```

The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter):
```sql
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
```

Aliases can be useful when:

- There are more than one table involved in a query
- Functions are used in the query
- Column names are big or not very readable
- Two or more columns are combined together
