## The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

```
Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.
```

SQL SERVER
```sql
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
MySQL
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;
```
Oracle 12
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name(s)
FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;
```

SELECT first 3 records (MySQL)
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;
```
